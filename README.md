# Red Hat peer review guide for technical documentation

## About

This guide documents best practices for peer reviewing Red Hat technical documentation. The guide also discusses tools to use when reviewing documentation, so that writers and reviewers can choose a method that best fits their workflow. We have also included a checklist for reviewers to use as a quick reference.
